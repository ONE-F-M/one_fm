                            <b>Transfer of your Personal Data</b><br />

                            Your information including Personal Data is processed at the Company's operating offices and

                            laws may differ than those from your jurisdiction.<br />

                            Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information

                            securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy, and no transfer of your Personal Data
                            will take place to an organization or a country unless there are adequate controls in place
                            including the security of your data and other personal information.<br />

                            <b>Law enforcement</b><br />

                            Under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to disclose your Personal Data if
                            required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g. a
                            court or a government agency).<br />

                            <b>Other legal requirements</b><br />

                            The Company may disclose your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is

                            The security of your Personal Data is important to us, but remember that no method of
                            transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we
                            strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot
                            guarantee its absolute security.<br />

                            from our servers.<br />

                            If we need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and your
                            country requires consent from a parent, we may require your parents' consent before we
                            collect and use that information.<br />

                            <b>Links to Other Websites</b><br />
