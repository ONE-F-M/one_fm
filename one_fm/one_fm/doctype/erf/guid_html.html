		<p>Performance-based Hiring Learning Systems</p>
		<p>
			This step-by-step guide offers a simple approach to convert traditional skills-based job descriptions into
			performance-based job descriptions, also called performance profiles. It’s best if prepared jointly with the hiring manager
			and the recruiter and sourcing team. This ensures everyone is on the same page.

				<h3> The Intake Meeting – Understanding the Job </h3>
			</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-xs-4">
				<p><b>Know the Job</b></p>
				<p>The job is not the job description, it’s what people actually do every day.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-8">
				<p>
					The best candidates will ask about the job. The bulk of a job can be described in 4-5 performance objectives.
					Recruiters who don’t know the job are viewed as gatekeepers. Hiring managers who can’t describe the job as career
					opportunities won’t be able to attract the strongest applicants.
				</p>

		<div class="row" style="background-color: #d3e1e6">
			<div class="col-xs-4">
				<p><b>Think DOING not HAVING</b></p>
				<p>The core of any job can be described in 4-5 basic performance objectives. These are defined during the intake meeting.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-8">
				<p>
					It’s what a person does with his/her skills that matters, not the skills themselves. Ask, “What does the person need to do
					to be considered successful?” or “What do the best people do differently?” Simple format: Action Verb + Task + Measure of
					Success + Timeframe. Example: “Within 60 days be able to complete 20 inbound help calls per day.”

				<p><b>Determine the Major Objectives</b></p>
				<p>Most jobs have 2-3 major objectives during the first year. Bigger jobs have longer time spans.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-8">
				<p>
					To determine the major objectives, ask about...
					<ul>
						<li>Major changes, problems or improvements</li>
						<li>Biggest goals the person needs to achieve</li>
						<li>What needs to be fixed?</li>
						<li>Short- and long-term</li>
						<li>Challenges</li>
					</ul>
					Once you’ve defined the major objectives, then define the sub-steps required to achieve them.
				</p>

				<p><b>Use Timeline to Develop the “Process of Success”</b></p>
				<p>Determine the critical subtasks the person needs to do to achieve the major objective.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-8">
				<p>
					Define what the person would need to do in the first 30, 60, 90 days as a sequence of steps to achieve
					the major objective. The critical subtasks then become part of the final performance-based job description.
					Typical Process of Success:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Learnand/orevaluatethesituation</li>
					<li>Meettheteam</li>
					<li>Consideralternatives</li>
					<li>Prepareplan</li>
					<li>Getresources</li>
					<li>Execute successfully</li>

				<p><b>Convert HAVING into DOING</b></p>
				<p>Convert hard and soft skills and competencies into performance objectives.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-8">
				<p>
					You can create some objectives by converting the most important skills and competencies into tasks by asking,
					“What does the person need to do with (behavior) in order to be considered strong?” For example, for strong
					communication skills, Present weekly progress reports to the executive team on the status of the marketing launch
					program.

				<p><b>Benchmark the Best</b></p>
				<p>For process jobs it’s better to benchmark the best people already doing the job using a “Day in the Life” approach.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="col-xs-8">
				<p>
					Another way to create objectives is to ask, “What do the best people do differently than the average person doing
					the same job?” This is the best approach for process (versus project) positions. Typically, the differences relate
					to work quality, quantity, productivity, consistency and work ethic.

			<div class="col-xs-8">
				<p>
					Draw a 360 degree work chart showing who the person works with and for, including staff and peers, inside and outside
					people, plus executives. When hiring managers, one of the performance objectives should be to build and develop the
					team. For everyone else, working with the team to accomplish an objective should be a performance objective.

				<p><b>Describe the Environment</b></p>

			<div class="col-xs-8">
				<p>
					Fit is as important to success as ability. In this case fit means fit with the job, fit with the hiring manager
					and fit with the company culture.
